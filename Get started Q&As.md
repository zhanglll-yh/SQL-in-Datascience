# SQL get started Q&As

Great set of questions! Let's take them one by one:

---

## ✅ **Question 1: What does *relational dataset* mean?**

A **relational dataset** is data organized into **tables** (like Excel sheets), where each table:

* Has **rows** (each row = a record, like an order or user)
* Has **columns** (each column = a field, like order date or user ID)
* Tables can be **related** to each other using **keys** (IDs)

### 🔗 Example:

| `orders` table | `products` table |              |        |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| order\_id      | product\_id      | product\_id  | name   |
| ----------     | ------------     | ------------ | ------ |
| 101            | A1               | A1           | Shirt  |
| 102            | B2               | B2           | Shoes  |

These tables are **relational** because `product_id` links them.

💡 SQL was specifically built to manage and query relational data using joins.

Syntax like INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc., are optimized and easy to use.

## ✅ **Question 2: Where do real-world datasets live? How are they handled?**

### 📦 **Where they live (storage systems):**

Most companies store datasets in:

| Type                        | Examples                      | Description                                            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ **Relational Databases**  | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server | Best for structured, day-to-day transactional data     |
| ✅ **Cloud Data Warehouses** | Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift | Scalable, fast analytics storage                       |
| ✅ **Data Lakes**            | AWS S3, Azure Data Lake       | For raw/unstructured or huge data (e.g., logs, images) |
| ✅ **CSV/Parquet files**     | Stored on cloud or local      | Often intermediate formats or exports                  |

### 🔄 **How data is handled (pipeline flow):**

1. **Data Ingestion**: Pull data from APIs, logs, databases, etc.
2. **ETL or ELT**:

   * Clean, join, enrich using SQL or Python
   * Store transformed data in warehouse
3. **Access & Use**:

   * Data analysts/scientists query data using **SQL**
   * BI tools (Tableau, Power BI) visualize it
   * Python/R used for machine learning or forecasting

✅ This is often done on a **daily or hourly schedule**, using pipelines (e.g., Airflow).

## ✅ **Question 3: What environments do people use to run SQL in the real world?**

They typically use **SQL in cloud or enterprise environments**, not locally like in school.

### 🌐 **Cloud SQL environments / data warehouses**:

| Tool                           | Description                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 🔷 **BigQuery (Google Cloud)** | SQL for massive datasets                       |
| ❄️ **Snowflake**               | Popular warehouse used across industries       |
| 🟥 **Redshift (AWS)**          | Amazon’s data warehouse                        |
| 🟢 **Azure Synapse**           | Microsoft’s warehouse tool                     |
| 🐘 **PostgreSQL / MySQL**      | Still used for smaller teams or internal tools |

### 🖥️ **How they use it:**

* Web UI: BigQuery / Snowflake have their own web dashboards for writing SQL
* SQL IDEs: **DBeaver**, **DataGrip**, or **Azure Data Studio**
* In **Notebooks**: Databricks, Jupyter (via `%sql`), or Hex
* In **BI tools**: Power BI, Tableau allow writing custom SQL queries
* In **Python/R** scripts: Use `pandas.read_sql()` or `SQLAlchemy` to fetch data
